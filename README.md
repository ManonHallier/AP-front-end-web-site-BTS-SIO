# AP-front-end-web-site-BTS-SIO
Here, you will find one of the first site (front-end) that I developed during my BTS. It was an exercise to allow us to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages.

If this site is not very aesthetic, it is because we had to respect strict instructions in terms of design.

---------- EXPLANATIONS  ----------
We needed to replicate a template and add a java script to allow the user to add assignments in the "add assignment" page. However, as this site is front-end only, data is not saved.

---------- SOME SCREENSHOTS ----------
